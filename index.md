<h2>Who We Are</h2>

Code the Change is a student group that partners with non-profits to work on year-long software projects for social good. Completely student-run, the club has a successful record working on projects to track the spread of cholera across Bangladesh, to help K-12 school teachers share project ideas, and to support homeless communities across the Bay.
